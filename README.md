GETTING STARTED :
Trello : (https://trello.com/b/poHlXpdq/criss-cross)
Go to site : ()

*Note 
AAU's at this point are only able to perform CRUD by logging in and clicking on the miscellaneous tab where they can create, read, update and delete comments. 
Upon doing that, they will have to log out and to access full functionality of the application.
This website is still very much under construction.

PLANNED FUTURE ENHANCEMENT INCLUDE:

An aau's ability to create their own travel blog by adding content to their own my destinations tab, my itineraries tab, memories tab and blog tab that will be accessible to non-authenticated users.
